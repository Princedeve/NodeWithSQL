Completed Node.js with MySQL project ðŸš€
I successfully completed my Node.js with MySQL project! ðŸŽ‰

Key implementations:
- Generated user data using Faker.js & UUID
- Built RESTful APIs with Express.js
- Created dynamic pages with EJS
- Added Method-Override & middlewares
- Implemented full CRUD (RESTful routes):
  â€¢ Show All Users
  â€¢ Add User
  â€¢ Edit Username
  â€¢ Update (DB)
  â€¢ Delete User

This project helped me understand how to integrate Node.js with MySQL
and build complete backend functionality step by step.

Excited to keep learning and exploring more advanced backend concepts! ðŸ’»âœ¨
